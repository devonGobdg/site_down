		<h2>This website is no longer operational. </h2>

		<h3>The design and development was completed on a good faith arrangement that payment would be made. To date, no payments have been provided, including hosting. </h3>
		<h3>We regret this drastic action, and the inconvenience this this may cause for you as a supporter of Urban Verde Gardens, however it is a necessary measure in getting what is rightfully ours.</h3>

		<h4>Sincerely, <a href="http://breakthroughdesign.com">The Breakthrough Design Group Team</a></h4>
